                        A practicing Customer Experience Research and Reporting Analyst, and Certified
                        Digital Strategist. I have led core digital teams in the change process and management
                        within the Digital space. I leverage on market Insights, Data, mobile and social media to
                        drive and deliver Customer Obsession and transformational strategy, in shaping the Customer
                        Experience and Digital Agenda Across the Organization

                        I decided to take up programming because, not only does it give a new perspective to
                        problem-solving, it also offers career flexibility within my organization in the
                        roles I can take up. There does also seem to be a high demand for coding-proficient professionals globally, which does also open up carees people more opportunities. To
                        quote Stephen Hawking, a Theoretical Physicist, Cosmologist and Author <em> “Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn.”</em>
                        I think it's also pretty cool to say,<em> "I'm a programmer".</em>
