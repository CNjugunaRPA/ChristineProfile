                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        A practicing Customer Experience Research and Reporting Analyst, and Certified Digital Strategist. I have led core digital teams in the change process and management within the Digital space. I leverage on market Insights, Data, mobile and social media to drive and deliver Customer Obsession and transformational strategy, in shaping the Customer Experience and Digital Agenda Across the Organization

                        I decided to take up programming because, not only does it give a new perspective to problem-solving, it also offers career flexibility within my organization in the roles I can take up. There does also seem to be a high demand for coding-proficient professionals globally, which does also open up carees people more opportunities. To quote Stephen 
                        Hawking, a Theoretical Physicist, Cosmologist and Author “Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st 
                        century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn.”
                        I think it's also pretty cool to say, "I'm a programmer".
